# Summarize PDF

Generate a structured summary of a PDF document.

## Instructions

1. If a PDF is already displayed, work with it
2. If user provides a new URL/path, call `display_pdf` first
3. Read through the document and produce:
   - **Title and authors** (if academic paper)
   - **Key findings** (3-5 bullet points)
   - **Methodology** (brief summary)
   - **Conclusions**
   - **Relevance** — what makes this paper notable

## Notes

- For long documents, focus on abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections
- Ask the user which sections they care most about if the doc is very long
